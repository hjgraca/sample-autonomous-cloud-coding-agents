"""Apply resolved registry assets (#246) to the agent's runtime environment.

The orchestrator resolves the Blueprint's ``registry://`` refs and threads a
bundle of ``{kind, namespace, name, version, runtime}`` entries into the payload
(``TaskConfig.resolved_assets``). Each per-kind loader here applies its runtime
payload:

  * ``mcp_server`` → merge the connection config into ``.mcp.json`` (PR 2).
  * ``cedar_policy_module`` / ``skill`` → PR 3.

The merge mirrors ``channel_mcp.configure_channel_mcp``: read the existing
``.mcp.json`` (if any), overlay the registry servers without clobbering other
entries, and write it back. Runs alongside the channel MCP wiring so the SDK's
project-scoped scan picks up both.
