"""Strands tool bridge to the AgentCore Gateway (ADR-019 P1).

ABCA federates its agent-facing MCP tools behind a single managed **AgentCore
Gateway** whose inbound auth is ``AWS_IAM`` (SigV4). A normal remote MCP client
can only attach a
STATIC ``Authorization`` header, so it cannot talk to a SigV4 endpoint — every
request needs a fresh signature over its own body + timestamp.

Rather than run a separate stdio proxy subprocess, this module bridges
**in-process**: the agent process already holds the compute role's AWS
credentials, so it registers a local Strands tool whose implementation:

1. resolves the compute role's credentials + region,
2. opens a SigV4-signed Streamable-HTTP MCP session to the Gateway
   (``service = "bedrock-agentcore"``), and
3. proxies the model's call to the federated Lambda-backed tool, returning its
   result as an SDK tool result.

The credentials never leave the process and there is no subprocess to manage.
The whole bridge is gated on :data:`GATEWAY_URL_ENV`: absent (local dev, tests,
or a deploy without ``--context enableToolGateway=true``) → :func:`build_gateway_tool`
returns ``None`` and the runner simply doesn't offer the tool.

This is the P1 slice — a single read-only tool (``abca_repo_config``). The
bridge discovers the federated tool by suffix (the Gateway exposes it as
``<targetName>___<toolName>``) so the agent side stays decoupled from the exact
target name the CDK picks.

Counterparts: ``cdk/src/constructs/tool-gateway.ts`` (the Gateway + target),
``cdk/src/handlers/tool-repo-config.ts`` (the Lambda the tool routes to).
