"""Per-task scoped AWS credentials for tenant-data access.

This module centralizes how the agent obtains boto3 clients/resources for
**tenant data** (the task's own DynamoDB rows and its S3 trace/attachment
objects). Instead of using the long-lived compute role (AgentCore Runtime
``ExecutionRole`` or ECS Fargate task role) directly, the agent assumes a
per-task **SessionRole** with session tags ``{user_id, repo, task_id}`` and
uses the resulting short-lived, tag-scoped credentials. The SessionRole's IAM
policy self-constrains via ``aws:PrincipalTag/*`` conditions
(``dynamodb:LeadingKeys`` on ``task_id`` for the task tables, an S3 prefix
condition on ``user_id`` for the trace bucket), so a compromised session can
only reach its own task's data — not other tenants'.

Two properties matter for correctness:

1. **Refreshable, not one-shot.** The agent runs under credentials that are
   themselves an assumed role, so the agent's own ``sts:AssumeRole`` is *role
   chaining*, which AWS hard-caps at 1 hour regardless of the role's
   ``MaxSessionDuration``. Tasks can run up to ``maxLifetime`` (8 h), so a
   single ``assume_role()`` call would yield credentials that expire mid-task
   and fail every subsequent call with ``ExpiredToken``. We wrap the assume
   call in botocore ``RefreshableCredentials`` so boto3 transparently
   re-assumes before expiry.

2. **Backend-agnostic.** The same code path works whether the agent boots
   under an AgentCore execution role or an ECS task role — both are valid
   assuming principals in the SessionRole trust policy.

**Fail-safe vs. fail-closed:**

- When ``AGENT_SESSION_ROLE_ARN`` is **unset** (local dev, tests, or a
  deployment that has not yet provisioned the SessionRole), this module returns
  plain boto3 clients/resources backed by the ambient credential chain —
  identical to the pre-feature behavior. Scoping is opt-in and its absence does
  not block task execution.
- When ``AGENT_SESSION_ROLE_ARN`` **is set**, scoping has been *requested*, so a
  failure to build the scoped session is treated as a hard error: this module
  raises :class:`SessionScopingError` rather than silently degrading to the
  ambient (cross-tenant) compute role. For a tenant-isolation control, silently
  running unscoped is the most dangerous failure mode — the agent keeps working
  but stops isolating tenants — so we fail **closed** (abort the task) instead.
