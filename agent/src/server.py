# AWS Lambda MicroVMs lifecycle hooks (ADR-021 P1)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The MicroVM backend has NO orchestrator→agent HTTP path: the task payload
# arrives as the ``/run`` hook's request body and nothing else dials in. The
# service calls these routes on the port declared in the image's ``hooks.port``
# (8080 — the same uvicorn process that serves /invocations and /ping), so the
# hooks live here rather than in a sidecar.
#
# Only ``/ready`` and ``/run`` are implemented, and both are P1:
#   * ``/ready`` is MANDATORY. ``CreateMicrovmImage`` refuses an image that
#     enables ANY lifecycle hook without it ("The ready (/ready) MicroVM image
#     hook must be enabled when any MicroVM lifecycle hook … is enabled"), and an
#     image with no hooks at all cannot receive a ``runHookPayload``. So ADR-021's
#     original "declare /run in P1, serve it in P2" split was not a reachable
#     service state.
#   * ``/run`` is the payload-delivery channel.
# ``/suspend`` and ``/resume`` are P3 (they need the ComputeStrategy interface
# widening), and ``/validate`` + ``/terminate`` are P2 polish. Declaring a hook
# the agent does not answer fails the corresponding build or lifecycle
# transition, which is why the construct declares exactly these two.
