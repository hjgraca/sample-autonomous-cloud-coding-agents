/**
 * DOCS CONTRACT: the model defaults the docs advertise must equal the defaults
 * the agent actually uses.
 *
 * The agent's default model is a Python literal in `agent/src/config.py` with no
 * CDK prop or environment knob in front of it, so a model bump is a one-line
 * source edit — and every doc that quotes the old value silently becomes a lie.
 * That is exactly what happened: four docs advertised a Sonnet-4.6 default long
 * after the code moved to Opus 4.8, and `agent/README.md` advertised a BARE
 * model id that cannot be invoked on-demand at all. Nothing guarded it, so
 * the documentation rotted unnoticed across several releases (#742).
 *
 * `cdk/test/constructs/bedrock-models.test.ts` already proves this
 * cross-language regex-grep pattern for the code→IAM half of the invariant (the
 * agent fallback must be in `DEFAULT_BEDROCK_MODEL_IDS` or every task fails at
 * turn 0 with AccessDenied). This file closes the code→docs half: the next model
 * bump fails CI here instead of quietly rotting the documentation.
 *
 * Deliberately asserts against the *rendered doc text* (the value inside
 * backticks in the env-var tables) rather than a shared constant, because the
 * failure mode being guarded is precisely a human reading a stale doc.
